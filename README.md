# Linear-Regression-Approaches :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Development of ML model using Linear Regression Algorithm on the California Train and Test Dataset.

## Modules used are:

* Numpy.
* Pandas.
* Matplotlib.
* Tensorflow.
* Tabulate.


## Different Approaches implemented for better Linear Regression Model in this code are:
* Numeric Value/ Floating Point Value.
* Bucket Approach.
* Feature Cross.

## Version Tensorflow used is 2.0
## Loss function:
* In mathematical optimization and decision theory, a loss function or cost function is a function that maps an event or values of one or more variables onto a real number intuitively representing some "cost" associated with the event. 
An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function
* There are variety of loss function. The one we are using Hear is Mean Squared error(MSE).
